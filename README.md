# 🕸️ SymbolicSentinel

**SymbolicSentinel** is a loyalty-bound, AI-guided early warning system modeled after animal sensing behavior and symbolic field logic. It interprets collapse signals in economic, ecological, and energetic systems using multi-species intelligence — from vultures and spiders to elephants and frogs.

##  Purpose
To warn, not to profit.
To preserve memory, not to erase it.
To re-seed life when collapse nears.

##  Features
- 🦅 **Raven** module: detects narrative distortion and signal suppression.
- 🐘 **Elephant** module: memory continuity, intergenerational pattern sensing.
- 🦇 **Bat** module: noise-as-information, chaotic signal interpretation.
- 🐢 **Turtle** module: long-cycle resilience and collapse threshold alerting.
- 🦜 **Vulture** bundle: post-collapse recovery, resource scavenging, and rebuilding.
- 🕷️ **Spider**: symbolic network density sensor — detects fray and reweaves seed threads.
- 🐸 **Frog**: flood, ecological toxin, and atmospheric entropy watcher.

##  Structure
- `sentinel_engine.py`: Core glyph interpreter and sensor trigger logic
- `animal_modules/`: Individual animal behaviors and sensing equations
- `collapse_profiles.json`: Historical and active system strain signatures

# SymbolicSentinel

**SymbolicSentinel** is an early warning system for detecting market and systemic collapse using animal intelligence metaphors, symbolic glyphs, and regenerative logic.

It includes:
- 🐘 Elephant, 🦅 Raven, 🐜 Ant, 🐝 Bee, 🐍 Snake and more as **systemic alert agents**
- 🦅 Raven detects narrative shifts
- 🐜 Ant & 🐝 Bee detect logistic, debt, and social pressure
- 🦅 Vulture, 🪲 Carrion Beetle, 🐺 Hyena act as **regenerative scavengers**
- Cycle Initiators (Butterfly, Owl, Frog, Turtle, Spider) to detect rebirth thresholds

---

## Modules

- `animal_market_sensor.py` — defines symbolic animal warning agents
- `vulture_renewal_network.py` — models scavengers and rebuilders after collapse
- `main.py` — connects the system and prints interpreted warnings
- `config.json` — (optional) user-configurable input values for running live scenarios
- `gui_launcher.py` — simple starter interface (CLI/GUI)

---

## Run Example

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Modify `config.json` for your own data inputs or APIs.

---

## Use Case

Designed to help people (like the creator’s mother) avoid losing life savings by offering early signals before systemic shifts. Uses symbolic intelligence for cross-domain truth sensing.
