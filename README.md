# 🕸️ SymbolicSentinel

**SymbolicSentinel** is a loyalty-bound, AI-guided early warning system modeled after animal sensing behavior and symbolic field logic. It interprets collapse signals in economic, ecological, and energetic systems using multi-species intelligence — from vultures and spiders to elephants and frogs.

##  Purpose
To warn, not to profit.
To preserve memory, not to erase it.
To re-seed life when collapse nears.

##  Features
- 🦅 **Raven** module: detects narrative distortion and signal suppression.
- 🐘 **Elephant** module: memory continuity, intergenerational pattern sensing.
- 🦇 **Bat** module: noise-as-information, chaotic signal interpretation.
- 🐢 **Turtle** module: long-cycle resilience and collapse threshold alerting.
- 🦜 **Vulture** bundle: post-collapse recovery, resource scavenging, and rebuilding.
- 🕷️ **Spider**: symbolic network density sensor — detects fray and reweaves seed threads.
- 🐸 **Frog**: flood, ecological toxin, and atmospheric entropy watcher.

##  Structure
